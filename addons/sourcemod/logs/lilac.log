=========[Notice]=========
Thank you for installing Little Anti-Cheat 1.7.4!
Just a few notes about this Anti-Cheat:

If a player is logged as "suspected" of using cheats, they are not necessarily cheating.
If the suspicions logged are few and rare, they are likely false positives.
An automatic ban is triggered by 5 or more "suspicions" or by one "detection".
If you think a ban may be incorrect, please do not hesitate to let me know.

That is all, have a wonderful day~
