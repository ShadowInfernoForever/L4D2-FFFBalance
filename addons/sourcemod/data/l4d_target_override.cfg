// Rearrange order to your preference for each Special Infected class.
// You can set any number of "order" values, all are not required to be entered.
// When no order value is matched, the Special Infected will default to using the games internal targeting logic.
//
// Order:		Prioritize who to attack first:
//				1	= Normal Survivor.
//				2	= Vomited Survivor.
//				3	= Incapacitated Survivor.
//				4	= Survivor Pinned (by Smoker, Hunter, Charger, Jockey).
//				5	= Ledge hanging Survivor.
//				6	= Vomited Special Infected (Tanks will not attack other Special Infected).
//				7	= Last Attacker. Only from bullets/melee weapons. Set after most/all other order priorities since there will always be a last attacker.
//				8	= Lowest Health Survivor.
//				9	= Highest Health Survivor.
//				10	= Survivor being Pummelled by Charger.
//				11	= Survivor mounted on a Mini Gun.
//				12	= Survivor reviving someone.
//				13	= Survivor furthest ahead in flow distance (requires Left4DHooks plugin).
//				14	= Survivor self healing when health is below the "survivor_limp_health" cvar value.
//				15	= Survivor furthest behind in flow distance (requires Left4DHooks plugin).
//				16	= Survivor with their Flashlight on.
//				17	= Survivor running (not crouched or walking).
//				18  = Survivor who dealt the highest damage.
//
// pinned:		Ignore attacking target when they're pinned by: 1=Smoker. 2=Hunter. 4=Jockey. 8=Charger. 15=All. Add numbers together.
// incap:		0=Ignore incapacitated players. 1=Allow attacking incapacitated players. 2=Only attack incapacitated players when they are vomited. 3=Only attack incapacitated when everyone is incapacitated.
// voms:		0=Off. 1=Allow attacking vomited Special Infected (order number 6).
// voms2:		0=Ignore attacking if target is currently covered in bile. 1=Allow attacking vomited incapacitated Survivors.
// range:		0.0=No limit. The maximum range to target someone, otherwise the plugin defaults to the games internal mechanics for targeting someone.
// dist:		How close the Special Infected must be to a target to prevent changing target.
// wait:		How many seconds to target someone before being allowed to switch to another target. They will switch before if the player is no longer valid or allowed to be targeted.

// targeted:	0=Ignored. Total number of Special Infected allowed to attack someone at the same time.
