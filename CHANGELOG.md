# Version History

> In this document, you can see all updates from each version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VERSION 10.75 - 21/11/2025

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some matchmodes were renamed.
- A FakePing by pa4H was added and edited to make it dynamic.
- l4d_freely_round_end was moved out of fixes since it’s not a fix, but a tweak.
- Stripper maps were reorganized (AGAIN).
- Some Stripper maps were edited for zonemod_t2.
- Stripper is now enabled by default, but it doesn’t include any map; this allows activating a map CFG at any time through a matchmode.
- Two configs were added for coop, versus, Equinix.cfg and HvS (or HM - HvS).
- The server title was fixed (it was changed because it didn’t fit in readyup).
- SG552 balance was changed; it needs testing.
- Shotguns were Balanced... needs testing and feedback.
- Documentation in modes.md was clarified a bit (still missing some things).
- Several objectives in TODO.md were completed, new ones were added, and others remain unfinished.
- Fixed L4D2 Attributes Again, because shotguns couldn't use reloaddurationmult, they instead used tankdamagemult.
